Using Pygame combined with PyTorch to generate and create a playable pokemon game.  

The model will learn and grow as more games are played and become a stronger opponent.  

## News:  

Currently we are only using Gen 1 pokemon, as well as very basic moves and attributes for each pokemon.  

We have only recently started the AI/ML learning journey, so it will take some time before the AI will be playable against

Recent Additions:
1) UI randomly generates 2 pokemon images (with back and front).  
2) 4 buttons created with changing text when clicked.  
3) Pokemon and moveset managers created so that each pokemon can have a realistic moveset.  


## Features Added:  

1) Menu Screen
2) Battle Screen
3) Basic AI implementation using [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giorgiocarbone/complete-competitive-pokmon-datasets-may-2022?select=bridge_move_type_MOVES_IS_TYPE.csv) dataset.  

Check out everything we have on the "deploy" branch on GitHub!
